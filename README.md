# Final Portfolio Project - Carlos B.

## 👋 About Me

Hey! I'm Carlos B., a graduating senior headed to De Anza College with plans to transfer to UC Davis or UC Berkeley to study Biology. This year I’ve grown a lot in computer science — from writing basic HTML to creating fully interactive JavaScript projects.

I’ve learned how to design, build, and improve websites using HTML, CSS, and JS. I’ve also gotten better at problem-solving, debugging, and thinking creatively. Everything here represents the skills I’ve developed and the passion I’ve put into my work.

## 📚 What This Project Is

This portfolio project represents everything I’ve learned in computer science this year—from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and responsive design. It’s a personal website that shows off who I am, the skills I’ve built, and the projects I’ve worked on. Through this project, I’ve learned how to structure a website, write clean code, and design user-friendly layouts.
